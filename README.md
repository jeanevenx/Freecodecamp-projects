# Responsive Web Design


In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I learned languages that developers use to build webpages:

- HTML for content, and 

- CSS for design.

### To obtain this certification, I built:

1. [A Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/eng-evenx/pen/MWErZJQ)

2. [A Survey Form](https://codepen.io/eng-evenx/pen/mdmNYwG)

3. [A Product Landing Page](https://codepen.io/eng-evenx/pen/BadRXRd)

4. [A Technical Documentation Page](https://codepen.io/eng-evenx/pen/GRMOaqQ)

5. [A Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://codepen.io/eng-evenx/pen/VwMXvQX)
